## Evaluation
When making the website I found that the grid system was really useful as it made positioning all of my sections really easy also meant that when making it responsive all it took were few lines of code changing the size of the columns, images, and text. I found that Vue was the hardest part to do as it played around with functions that I'd never touched before, although I found it relatively easy to pick up after a short while and can see why it's popular. Using SASS for the first time allowed me to layout my CSS more easily as I could spread my styling for different parts of the website over different files, also the addition of nesting and naming conventions for colors meant that code was easier to write and read. If I was to make the website again I'd give my self more time to put in a link to firebase so that the information inputted into the contact form could be stored in a database. I think that the website's final outcome is pretty good, it has good functionality working on both mobile and desktop, my code is easily readable, my file structure is easy to navigate and the website looks good.

##  Environment configuration 

- This project depends on node version 6 or higher
- On a personal computer the version of node should be determined by running `node â€“v`.
  [If the version is lower than 6, then update node & npm before you progress]( https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
- If cloud9 (my teaching set up) is being used as a learning tool/development environment node version manager(nvm) can be used to upgrade to the correct version of node. From within your root workspace folder run:

  - `nvm install 6`
  - `nvm alias default 6` 


## Running the project 
- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/dannfielding/swd500.git`
- Run the following commands:

- `npm install`  : install the dependencies 
- `npm run watch`: will run webpack continuously 

- The build will be output to the `dist` folder every time you update a file that's part of the 
project bundle. Never edit anything in the dev folder. 


## Creating new HTML pages

- Each time you create a new HTML file you will need to import it in `main.js`
  e.g. ``import '../index.html';``
- Ensure the `<script src="bundle.js"></script>` tag is included above the `</body>` tag in the new HTML page.


## Configuration (webpack.config.js)

- The project works out of the box, however it is expected that students will extend it.  Or, at the very minimum, play around with the settings.

### Copying assets to the dist folder 

- To copy non-bundled assets to the dist folder simply add the asset `from` and `to` location to the `CopyWebpackPlugin array`. The asset can be a file or a whole folder. 

```javascript
new CopyWebpackPlugin([
            {from: 'src/images', to: 'images'},
            {from: 'src/fonts', to:  fonts}
        ])
```
